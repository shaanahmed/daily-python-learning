# %% 1. The "Empty Check" (Conversion to Boolean)
"""Goal: Understand which values Python considers "Empty" or False.
Task: Create a program that takes a string input. Use the bool() function to convert that input to a Boolean.
Challenge: Run the program twice. Once, type something (e.g., "Vietnam") and see the result. The second time, just press Enter without typing anything.
Logic: This helps you understand "Falsy" values in Python."""

user = input("Enter anything: ")
print(bool(user))
